title: OPNSense config to delete Bell HH 2000 from your setup - OPNSense
date: '2024-08-22'

After much forum trawling and a super late night, I finally got my OPNSense configured so that my Bell ethernet, straight from my fiber converter, can now plug straight into OPNsense WAN instead of first through my HH2000.

*Note. If you have Bell TV as well, there is further config around VLAN 36. Since I didn’t do that config, I didn’t document it as I can’t verify it.
Follow my easy guide for internet then I bet it will be easier to adapt any further config changes needed for your TV from guides like this one: [BELL FIBE IPTV (Ontario) (opnsense.org)](https://forum.opnsense.org/index.php?topic=24785.0).*

## 1. Make a configuration backup just in case.

System > Config > Backups > Download Configuration

Just in case you screw something up, you can revert easily enough.

## 2. Create VLAN 35

Interfaces > Other Types > VLAN > New
As pictured, the name needs to start with vlan0. I made mine vlan0.35 but it doesn't matter.
Set the Parent as the interface for your WAN.
Set the tag as 35
VLAN priority NEEDS to be Best Effort (0, default).
Description is whatever you want.

## 3. Make a new point to point device

Interfaces > Point to point > Devices > add
Link type is PPPoE
Link Interface needs to be only your new vlan you just made.
Description is whatever you want.
Put your Bell username and password here
Click Save

## 4. Configure your WAN interface

Interfaces > Assignments
From the dropdown for your wan device, select the new PPPoE device you just made.
Click Save
![assign wan](/img/bell2000%20(3).png "Assign WAN")

## 5. WAN device config

Interfaces > wan [or whatever you’ve named your wan, mine’s Bell]

Here we can see the identifier is indeed wan.
The device is using our new point to point we just made in this guide.
Description is whatever you want.
IPv4 config type is PPPoE
No need to spoof the H2000’s MAC or anything so that’s just blank.

![wan config](/img/bell2000%20(4).png "WAN config")

Scroll a bit more

Here we can see the modem port is the vlan we just made.
Once again your Bell username and password goes here, however I believe it will auto-populate from your device config above.

Click save!

## 6. Flip your networking cables around

Pull the ethernet cable going into your home hub FROM your fiber converter box, and instead plug it in where your home hub 2000 is plugged in on your OPNsense box. There, home hub eliminated from the loop!

## 7. Test

Interfaces > Devices > Point to point > Log file

You should see successful attempts under Informational logs.
You may have to reboot your entire router first.

The big gotcha for me was I, for some reason, set priority on my vlan to super high – it just won’t talk to Bell that way. As well make sure your PPPoE device is only tagged with the vlan network, not your wan nic as well or you’ll connect and everything will work BUT you’ll have a second pppoe connection trying and failing to connect to Bell as well, in your logs, until the end of time. I’m sure Bell wouldn’t appreciate that either.
